## Authoring notes

Quantum novel is both fact and fiction.  Write for translation OUT of _En_
lang bases only.

Read this with warning to stop and consider the spaces where indigenous 
bodies once thrived. The humans indigenous to the lands understand more 
than imports do, about everything that matters to keep a planet 
functioning.

    Process with Caution: 

          Indigenous peoples have been at this much longer than 
          colonizers have been putting delusional deeds, stakes, 
          radio towers, and other media empires on our soil. Is 
          better to assume you know ¨much much¨ less about quantum 
                               than you think you do.

          Acknowledgement of the invalidity of the colonial 
          world view (and its property deeds) can be done with 
          respect to an indigenous people's native language, and 
          to its survivors. This collection of code, data, analysis,
          and statistics for deeper analysis (if you still do not 
          believe or ¨trust¨ indie) is complementary to 
          ecosteader.com; both can be used to better understand 
          the ¨whys¨ of Turtle Island Native L.A.W. and its protocols.

          Note to former colleagues in the hardware world:
             no, you are not hated; the hardware that can send messages
             and sounds globally ought not be loaned to entities
             who translate for colonist cash.
