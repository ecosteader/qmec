## Author notes

Our quantum novel is both fact and fiction. 

We write this with warning to consider the spaces where indigenous bodies
once thrived. The humans indigenous to the lands understand better than any 
settler-minded colonial takes on indie´s digital and IRL:

... the order of spores held close by ferns and lichens and moss which, with 
the help of the fungi, speed up the return of fallen branches and leaves, 
decomposition to give the forests that earthy smell with fruiting bodies to 
feed the sticky snail so he can, in a rip and crack then feed the joyful 
scrubjay with strength to fly and fill the forest with his talkative calls. 

... the order of the two Hydrogens paired with the one Oxygen, floating around 
sometimes tied, sometimes loose, mixing here and there with salt and sand and 
quenching roots and throats, recycling their dances over and over and tiring 
not at all.

... the fascinating shapes of a forest ecosystem, the distribution of not just 
classes, but orders of life and species and stars ... 

    where some collapse.            where some evolve. some revolve,
             and some dissolve 
                      completely out of orbit.                        

Bioremediation is one way to heal sick and suffering Earth systems. When humans 
with large illusions of authority unleash toxic warfare upon the soils, the 
¨meshieset¨ networks already exist.
