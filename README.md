    Process with Caution: 

          Indigenous peoples have been at this much longer than 
          colonizers have been putting delusional deeds, stakes, 
          radio towers, and other media empires on our soil. Is 
          better to assume you know ¨much much¨ less about quantum 
                               than you think you do.

          Acknowledgement of the invalidity of the colonial 
          world view (and its property deeds) can be done with 
          respect to an indigenous people's native language, and 
          to its survivors. This collection of code, data, analysis,
          and statistics for deeper analysis (if you still do not 
          believe or ¨trust¨ indie) is complementary to 
          ecosteader.com; both can be used to better understand 
          the ¨whys¨ of Turtle Island Native L.A.W. and its protocols.

          Note to former colleagues in the hardware world:
             no, you are not hated; the hardware that can send messages
             and sounds globally ought not be loaned to entities
             who translate for colonist cash.  

          Get ready to read and listen twice as hard as you speak:

          Fascistbook's abuses and assaults on Turtle Island  
          needed stopped; the Ivy leaguers' social network launched
          aggressive, hostile experiments on the already most 
          oppressed.  No one else would stand up to stop it as 
          it sought more to add to its burgeoning billions (nor
            as it cashed out on trillions and stole native works),  
          and its paying customers who treat indigenous peoples as 
          expendibles.
