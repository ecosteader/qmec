    Process with Caution: 

          Indigenous people have been at this much longer 
          than colonizers have been putting delusional deeds 
          on our soil. Better to assume you know ¨much much¨ 
          less about quantum 
                               than you think you do.

          Acknowledgement of the invalidity of the colonial 
          world view (and your property deeds) can be done with 
          respect to an indigenous people´s native language. This 
          repo is _complementary_ to ecosteader.com; both can 
          be used to understand Turtle Island.

          Get ready to read and listen twice as hard as you speak.

          Fascistbook´s abuses and assaults on Turtle Island 
          needed stopped; indigenous peoples are not its           lab rats. 
          Ongoing things result in the same murderous 
          genocides. 

              GET OFF FASCISTBOOK AND FIND AN ECOSTEADER!

## Authoring notes

Quantum novel is both fact and fiction. It written for translation OUT 
OUT of _En_lang bases only.

Read this with warning to stop and consider the spaces where indigenous 
bodies once thrived. The humans indigenous to the lands understand:

insert very very specific indiegeo <ntv.lang> translations &&

... the order of spores held close by ferns and lichens and moss which, with 
the help of the fungi, speed up the return of fallen branches and leaves, 
decomposition to give the forests that earthy smell with fruiting bodies to 
feed the sticky snail so he can, in a rip and crack then feed the joyful 
scrubjay with strength to fly and fill the forest with his talkative calls. 

... the order of the two Hydrogens paired with the one Oxygen, floating around 
sometimes tied, sometimes loose, mixing here and there with salt and sand and 
quenching roots and throats, recycling their dances over and over and tiring 
not at all.

... the fascinating shapes of a forest ecosystem, the distribution of not just 
classes, but orders of life and species and stars ... 

    where some collapse.            where some evolve. some revolve,
             and some dissolve 
                      completely out of orbit.                        

Bioremediation is one way to heal sick and suffering Earth systems. When humans 
with large illusions of authority unleash toxic warfare upon the soils, the 
¨meshieset¨ networks already exist.

# hints

BE CERTAIN translation INT ¨additional¨ colonizer languages like Latin, French, 
Greek, Roman Catholic, Spanish, Russian will waste your time and continue to 
eliminate your healthy escape options. The colonized planet already has the 
proof you need in its trash and waste.
