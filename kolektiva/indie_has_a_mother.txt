My mother taught her daughters to always deny the oppressor.  Although I met only one of my two half sisters, what I know about us collectively is strength despite colonialist attacks. 

She ran away from the Polish guy because something attacking EastCoast Indians nearly abused her to death.  And stole her daughter, trying to gaslight her with some fascist cop-state garbage not unlike what fascistbook still does to families who entrust it today. (Letting that THING anywhere near people distorts everything about reality. Give it all the props it needs to implode itself into the fabric of its own fake world of lies and deceit, but stop valuing it in the billions or trillions.  DIVEST FROM SOFTWARE TECH COMPANIES VALUING THEMSELVES IN THE BILLIONS, TENS OR HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS, AND ESPECIALLY THE TRILLIONS!!)

Our mother healed in the desert with some medicine people, met my biological father who has no genetic relation to Polish! 28 or 29 months after her second daughter was stolen, I was born.

Youngest daughter mourned the loss of missing siblings with her the longest, even as the attacks on our family grew more and more sadistic and invasive.. until eventually her 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th birthed children were all taken as child hostages by fascist state cops.  

Like my mother, I mourn the awful things shipped-ins and European settlers went thru on their continent, but that does not mean I think we should endorse replication of male, patriarchal-dominated accounting (Columbus was colonialist from the kicked out  "network" keep destroying EVERYTHING her tears were shed for!   

Maybe youngest daughters who wait longest to breed ensure no replication of   egomaniacal billionares  geoncidal colonist cash to try and DISTORT her.
