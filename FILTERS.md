This code and disclaimer are REQUIRED as part of FILTERS; 
especially important where (new_lang in [ntv.lang] ) translators exist.

                        notes about the meta STRUCT

// Note: A $disagreer that the ¨system¨ was overly generous to the oligarchs who touted 
// ¨religion¨ (reformed or not) is probably an oligarch. Test with ¨years on RCT¨ in ancestry, 
// and look for ancestry records prized by descendants of the 13 original colonies.

// a $disagreer should have migration logic to at least their indexed 3gGP before attempting 
// rights to parcel, acreage, plat, explore, fly over, mine drill / etc.
