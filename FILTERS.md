0: A $disagreer that the ¨system¨ was overly generous to the oligarchs who touted 
  ¨religion¨ (reformed or not) is probably an oligarch. Test with ¨years on RCT¨ in ancestry, 
   and look for ancestry records prized by descendants of the 13 original colonies.  

1: DISALLOW ADMIN AUTHORITY TO FB USERS.

2: A $disagreer should have migration logic to at least their indexed 3gGP, which will show 
   the incorrect PATHS of their ancestors´ migration logic thru treaty violations.  Eliminate the
   grazing of cattle on BLM land 

3: Previous learning as ¨GROUND TRUTH¨ >>> there no such thing as valid colonial
