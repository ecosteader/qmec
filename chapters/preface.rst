Preface
=======

The biological world as a sort of spiritual boundary on the physical world... this is 
the realm where our survival efforts, environmental constructs, and experiments in 
what humanity deems as "ingenuity" overlapthe quantum universe is almost unfathomable in 
its complexity. 

"Believe in the Universe that holds the Multiverse?"

"Yes, but remember there are limits, even known theoretical limits of many proofs."
