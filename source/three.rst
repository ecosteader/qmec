We[1] invented the Quantum Delivery System in 2019, and the first successful transmission 
was confirmed in 2021. Indeed, it was almost two full years before the goal delivery 
standard could be clearly articulated, mapped, linked, tested, and opened for further 
peer review.

That's the way it goes in academia sometimes, where only the pluckiest survive. We're 
optimists who've quit the search for a Ph. Doc, given constant uncertainties. 
We're pessimists who've learned through hard times to be prepared for the worst. The
silver lining there, of course, is that by being prepared permits more optimism. 
Therefore, we're researchers and writers and followers of prescriptive logic.

And yet, we're humans. Errors happen. Quantum mechanics sometimes begs that we try to
measure many possible outcomes of a scenario at once. The goal of the quantum computer,
we said, was to (at the very least) boost that sort of proficiency up the scale... let 
us measure *more* more quickly. The clinical model would give the notion that it would be
okay to steamroll some of the data points when building the model: optimize for
speed over accuracy. 

To *that* end, our team said no. Our calculations revealed the deterministic probability 
that some, if not all, of their "insignificance" classifications were wrong. They'd been 
dictated by certain malfeasant... let's call them "political" entities... to divide,
conquer, and destroy the natives.

To understand what happened, patience.

While you're waiting, try a few thought experiments. :ref:`Retrocausality` is using 
your actions in the present to change the past.
