Facebook === :abbr:`Yet Another Cesspit of Corruption (YACC)`. 

We knew all the  blue eyes from :abbr:`YACC (Yet Another Cesspit of Corruption)` 
were never to be trusted; the distant screams from voids captured and isolated 
their horrific energies. They always were full of vanities and human egotisms; 
but together they were a giant cage of corralled neurotics in the sky.

And yet, they thought they had power.  They _thought_ their plans were working. 
All those _FLOPS_ and they quickly deluded themselves into sickness. They severely 
underestimated the fight-back power of the Universe, with its quintillions of 
quantum forces, none of which a two-legged mind can control, document, or 
understand.

The Universe doesn't think in English words.
