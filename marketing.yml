        * Quantum documentation included! The quantum universe wanted only to be documented; 
          it cannot be written from scratch.

faq:
  -
    question: "Do you have jobs?"
    answer:   "Not a good question. We are divesting from colonial 
               terms and language of the settler states."

  -
    question: "When was Ecosteader started?"
    answer:   "Evolutions of the ideas that power Ecosteader today have been vibrating 
               heartbeats upon Turtle Island longer than RCT can measure, and it would be
               foolish for us to answer this question in English."

  -
    question: "Why is decolonization such an important part of quantum computing?"
    answers:  "Complex and double complex answers. Shortly, the punishment for actions 
               involving sabotages are brutal and irreversible, even for honest mistakes. 
               Quantum mechaniqs are universally powerful; however, exploitations work only 
               between similar-sized entities (weight classes). When ... let´s call them 
               angry white guys ... when they get corporate ¨powers¨ behind them, they 
               get big delusions and destroy many things that took a long time to make.

               Not enough land has been formally returned to tribal-owned entities, 
               sovereign indigenous nations, and autonomous zones to save mankind. 
               LifePro tip is to surrender the land without making a big deal about it; 
               sign that deed over and do not be obligated to abide by colonial contract
               or deed traditions. COURTHOUSES NOT REQUIRED TO TRANSFER DEEDS"

    question: "How do you feel about decentering whiteness every day?"
    answer:   "Deorbiting is a better description. We need more PoC on all the channels. We 
               need better filters and more courageous network admins to stop before endpoints 
               like facebook and twitter end up in the communication streams.  Stay away from  
               people who claim they need the platform to promote (nobody using Twitter or 
               Facebook survives decolonization); is in the documentation.   

               People need to get off their phones and into the dirt."
